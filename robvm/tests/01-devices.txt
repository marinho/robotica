Resistors
---------

    >>> from robvm.devices import Resistor, RESISTOR_TYPE_FIXED,\
    ...     RESISTOR_TYPE_VOLATILE
    >>> from robvm.chemicals import Si, C, O, WrongChemical
    >>> from robvm.units import ohm, volt, ampere

Transforms eletric power to thermal power (joule effect).

    >>> myres = Resistor()

Can be made from carbon or silicon.

    >>> myres = Resistor(made_from=Si)
    >>> myres = Resistor(made_from=C)

    >>> try:
    ...     myres = Resistor(made_from=O)
    ... except WrongChemical:
    ...     print 'WrongChemical'
    WrongChemical

They can be fixed or volatiles.

    >>> myres = Resistor(type=RESISTOR_TYPE_FIXED)
    >>> myres = Resistor(type=RESISTOR_TYPE_VOLATILE)

The main characteristics of resistor are 'resistance' ...

    >>> myres = Resistor(resistance=10*ohm)

... and 'tolerance'

    >>> myres = Resistor(tolerance=10*ohm)

Other characteristic is 'temperature coefficient'

    >>> myres = Resistor(temperature_coefficient=10*ohm)

Other characteristic is 'noise'

    >>> myres = Resistor(noise=10*ohm)

Other characteristic is 'inductance'

    >>> myres = Resistor(inductance=10*ohm)

Other characteristic is 'critical resistance'

    >>> myres = Resistor(critical_resistance=10*ohm)

A resistor has a resistance 1*ohm if a Tension of 1*volt on it make 
run in it a current flow with 1*ampere intensity, what means 1*coulomb
of power charge.

V = 7.5*volt
R = 10*ohm
A = V / R = 0.75*ampere

The 'flow' method must return a dictionary with some properties of
the flow out, but the main thing here is that it have to move the
flow to the next devices on the other wire.

    >>> myres = Resistor(resistance=10*ohm)
    >>> myres.flow(voltage=7.5*volt) == 0.75*ampere
    True

Transistors
-----------

    >>> from robvm.devices import Transistor

Capacitor
---------

    >>> from robvm.devices import Capacitor

Diode
-----

    >>> from robvm.devices import Diode

Led
---

    >>> from robvm.devices import Led

All of them together
--------------------

Just a simple schema, a converter using Zener diode and transistor, that
receives in 12V and responses out 6V.

    >>> from robvm.devices import Board, Battery, In, Out, SIGNAL_POSITIVE,\
    ...     SIGNAL_NEGATIVE

    >>> simple = Board()
    >>> simple['vin_p'] = In(signal=SIGNAL_POSITIVE)
    >>> simple['vin_n'] = In(signal=SIGNAL_NEGATIVE)
    >>> simple['vout_p'] = Out(signal=SIGNAL_POSITIVE)
    >>> simple['vout_n'] = Out(signal=SIGNAL_NEGATIVE)
    >>> simple['r1'] = Resistor()
    >>> simple['q1'] = Transistor()
    >>> simple['zd1'] = Diode()

    >>> simple['vin_p'].connect_to(simple['q1'].wire_1)
    >>> simple['vin_p'].cable.connect_to(simple['r1'].wire_1)
    >>> simple['q1'].wire_2.connect_to(simple['vout_p'])
    >>> simple['vin_n'].connect_to(simple['vout_n'])
    >>> simple['zd1'].wire_2.connect_to(simple['q1'].wire_3)
    >>> simple['r1'].wire_2.connect_to(simple['zd1'].wire_2.cable)
    >>> simple['vin_p'].cable.connect_to(simple['zd1'].wire_1)
